# Airbnb

Me and my group made an app based on the already made app-AIRBNB. Which is used to to find a place to stay for how many people you want and for how many days you want, in any city.


In this project we used HTML CSS Typescript Node js and MongoDB. We used these technoligies because it is what we learned at the time.    This was 
a concluding class project to the MONGODB and Node subject.

Some of the challenges we had were working with an existing data base provided by mongodb.Which didnt work for us because of small things in the their schema.
We ended up making a data base on our own.

## How to Install and Run the Project-
You need to write in the terminal- **npm i** 
Which installs everything in the express

Then type  - **npm i nodemon**
Which opens the connection with the localhost

## How to Use the Project-
You select in the navigation bar a city in Israel and for how many guests you want staying with you, or you press on one of the city cards to go to a page with 
a list of options for the city youve chosen. 

Then you press on a prefered airbnb option inorder to see more information on the prefered airbnb youve chosen.

To see admin options login with username: admin, password: 0000 ,"i am a"=admin.

###### Update:
 I recently went back to the project and redid/added features. I made the website responsive to different platforms, imporved the use of the middleware, added a function which checks the logged in cookie so the nav bar greets the user in every page and changed the graphics of website.
